**Ways to keep on track in PWK**  _The purpose of this is to better our process, and enable us to work together contributing to one another's success. Please remember, this doc will not be all-inclusive or cover every aspect you may encounter. It is merely there to remind you of the process and help when your nerves make your brain forget a useful command._ **This is a work in progress and I'm sharing now to encourage collaboration.**
